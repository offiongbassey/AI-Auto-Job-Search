# AI Auto Job Search 🚀

In the world of AI multi-agent systems, where massive transformations are taking place, it's crucial that we automate repetitive and redundant tasks.

Searching for jobs shouldn't be a daily routine anymore, especially now that AI agents can handle such tasks while we focus on more meaningful and strategic work.

What amazes me most is how these agents go beyond task execution—they **think**, **collaborate**, **delegate**, conduct **deep research**, and even handle errors gracefully.

**CrewAI** makes all of this possible. Kudos to the team behind it. 🙌

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

**Step 1: Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

pip install crewai crewai_tools python-dotenv
```
**Step 2: Run the project**
```
python main.py
```

That's it! Your AI agents are ready to work.

## What’s Next?
You can take this project further by:

- Setting up cron jobs to run the search automatically at set intervals

- Integrating SMTP or SendGrid for early-morning job notifications via email

- Improving result formatting and filtering logic

- Expanding to other job platforms
